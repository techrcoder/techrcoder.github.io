      <p class="detail-subhead" style="font-weight: bold;">Final exams, new projects, and preparing for USC. Reflecting
        on my journey and future
        goals.</p>

      <div class="detail-body">
        <p>
          As the last IB exam paper is handed in and my calculator finally takes a break, it feels surreal to think this
          chapter is closing. The IB wasn’t just an academic journey—it was a test of stamina, focus, and self-belief.
          Whether it was sprinting between classes with an HL Physics textbook in one hand and a coffee in the other, or
          debating the definition of "knowledge" in TOK, I’ve grown in ways that I’m only just starting to recognize.
        </p>

        <p>
          With final grades behind me and university life on the horizon, I find myself thinking more about who I want
          to become—not just what I want to study. USC is a huge leap forward, and I’m excited not just about the
          sunshine and palm trees, but about the intellectual environment where technology, entrepreneurship, and human
          creativity intersect.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll be diving deep into artificial intelligence and its real-world applications, especially in business. That
          overlap—between machine learning, human behavior, and economic decision-making—feels like the future, and I
          want to be part of shaping it. My upcoming internship will give me a first-hand look into the financial world,
          where I hope to observe how data-driven models are influencing investment strategies and risk management.
        </p>
        <p>
          But honestly? What excites me most is the unknown. New people. New perspectives. New challenges that push me
          to rethink everything I thought I knew. I’ve always been curious—not just about systems and code, but about
          people, ideas, and the stories behind decisions. As I step into this next chapter, I hope to keep that
          curiosity alive. I want to ask better questions, not just find better answers.
        </p>

        <p>
          IB gave me structure, but now I’m ready for flexibility. The kind that lets me take a class on ethics in AI in
          the morning and pitch a startup idea in the afternoon. The kind that demands responsibility but rewards
          creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking ahead, I hope to merge the technical with the human. Whether it’s building models that help people
          make smarter financial decisions or designing tools that expand accessibility, I want my work to matter. I
          want it to be useful, thoughtful, and built with intention.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, though, I’m taking a moment to breathe, say thank you to the teachers and friends who kept me going,
          and get ready for what’s next.

        </p>

        <p> <b>
            Here’s to the next chapter—may it be filled with learning, growth, and a little bit of fun along the way.
          </b>
