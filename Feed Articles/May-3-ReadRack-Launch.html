          I've launched Read-Rack to the App Store! This is a major milestone for me as a developer, and I'm excited to share it with the world. The app is designed to help users manage their reading lists and track their progress. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it!
          Read-Rack development was based entirely on vibe-coding principles, taking advantage of the ground-breaking AI technologies that are available today. I used ChatGPT to help me with the design and implementation of the app, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. The app is now available for download on the App Store, and I can't wait to hear your feedback!
