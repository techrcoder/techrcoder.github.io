        <p>I am excited to return to the Bank of Ireland in Paris for an internship in their Leveraged Acquisitions Finance offices. This opportunity will allow me to support analysts and associates with due diligence processes and the preparation of concise one- or two-page reports summarizing key findings and recommendations.</p>

        <p>In addition to these responsibilities, I aim to apply my knowledge of artificial intelligence to explore how new technologies can enhance the productivity of financial analysts. Specifically, I plan to research and prototype the use of large language model (LLM)-powered analytical tools. These tools could improve context understanding and streamline the processing of complex financial data, enabling analysts to work more efficiently and make better-informed decisions.</p>

        <p>As the internship has not yet started, these goals represent the aspirations and plans I hope to achieve during my time at the Bank of Ireland. I look forward to contributing to their team while gaining valuable professional experience in the field of finance and technology.</p>
